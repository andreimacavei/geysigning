GNOME Keysign  is a tool to make signing OpenPGP keys as easy as possible.
This is the v1.0 release and brings a lot of major and minor fixes all over the program.


Changes
==========

-Major
 * New gpg library which replaces monkeysign dependency
 * Replaced 'qrencode' with pure python QR code generator 'qrcode'
 * Added internationalization & localization support
 * Optimised finding the correct key to download
 * Removed once discovered clients if they disappear
 * Added tests for new GPG library

-Minor
 * Experimental compatibility for older Gtk versions (set_always_show_image)
 * Minor UI improvement: Do not delete the manually typed fingerprint when going back
 * Also accept more correctly typed fingerprint with a more relaxed verification routine
 * Display a message when the user does not have any private keys
