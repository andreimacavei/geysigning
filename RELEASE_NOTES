GNOME Keysign  is a tool to make signing OpenPGP keys as easy as possible.
This is the v0.3 release and bring a few tiny fixes all over the program.

Changes
==========

 * Optimised finding the correct key to download
 * Removed once discovered clients if they disappear
 * Experimental compatibility for older Gtk versions (set_always_show_image)
 * Minor UI improvement: Do not delete the manually typed fingerprint when going back
 * Also accept more correctly typed fingerprint with a more relaxed verification routine
