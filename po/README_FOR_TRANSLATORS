If you wish to add a .po file in your language then call this command while in po/ folder

msginit --input=gnome-keysign.pot --locale=xx_XX


And replace 'xx_XX' with your locale (i.e: en_EN for English).
After this  '.po' file is generated for your language and you can translate the strings in it.
The app then must be re-build to include the new translations.
